            <h2>Introduction</h2>
        </div>
        <p>Routing is arguably at the core of all ASP.Net MVC applications. Managing your routes can become cumbersome, frustrating, and unproductive. Some developers utilize a catch all route, which may lead to unexpected problems as their application grows. Restful Routing solves this issue by providing an opinionated process of registering routes, and connecting resources.</p>
        <p>This site is developed using Restful Routing and the source is available at Github. It was developed to help those getting started explore this library, in addition to helping those already familiar with the project get acquainted with some of the power features.</p>
        <p>Restful Routing has a <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/restful-routing">community of developers</a> waiting to help answer questions. You will find that this library is so easy to use that you willl wonder how you ever developed ASP.Net MVC applications without it.</p>
        <p>Thank You and Good Luck.</p>
