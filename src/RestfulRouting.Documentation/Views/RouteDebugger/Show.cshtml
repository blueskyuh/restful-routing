<h2>Basics</h2>
<p>Restful Routing comes with a powerful route debugger aimed at helping you understand your route mappings. You can enable and disable the route debugger purely by adding the following line to your RouteSet.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
map.DebugRoute("routedebug");  // easy right?
</pre>
<p><strong>Make sure to unregister the route debugger when deploying to your production environment. There is no performance hit, but you might not want to expose sensitive routes. </strong></p>
