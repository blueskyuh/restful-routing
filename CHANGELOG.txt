== 1.1.1

* Added ApplicationController to the package which provides a RespondTo wrapper around FormatResult.

* Added Mime type parser so FormatResult can respond to the accept header as well as the format route parameter.

* Added FormatResult which behaves like respond_to do |format| in rails. This handles mapping the request via the format (/blogs/1.xml).

== 1.1.0

* Changed StandardMapper method to `map.Path("test").To<Controller>(x => x.Action())` [Steve Hodgkiss]

* Add `.Named("name")` to StandardMapper [Steve Hodgkiss]

* Added RouteDebug route with `map.DebugRoute("routedebug")` [Steve Hodgkiss]

* Added named routes for Resource, Resources and Root [Steve Hodgkiss]

* Added PathNames method to change the name of predefined actions, i.e. PathNames(x => x.CreateName = "upload") [Steve Hodgkiss]

* Added WithRouteHandler to specify the route handler for the current scope and below. [Steve Hodgkiss]

* Refactored to use typed actions instead of untyped ones, i.e. more like rails 2 routes. This is a big change. [Steve Hodgkiss]
	The routes are no longer specified in the constructor, their is an abstract Map method that gets called with
	the Mapper.

== 1.0.2 - Last version to work with .NET 3.5

* Added `WithFormatRoutes` method to generate format routes [Steve Hodgkiss, Khalid Abuhakmeh]
